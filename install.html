          Praisenter installation isn't the most straight forward. There are 2-3 steps and some of those steps scare off
          potential users due to security concerns. All of these short comings could be resolved by signing Praisenter 
          with a certificate issued from a valid root certificate authority.  Unfortunately, this isn't cheap. 
          That said, we are looking into other deployment options to avoid the cost in the future.
