        <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> <em>2026-01-21</em></p>

        <h5>Overview</h5>
        <p>
          Praisenter is designed with privacy as a core principle. The Praisenter application operates primarily on the
          local system
          and does not collect, track, transmit, or store personal data outside of the user's device.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any limited usage information that may be collected is handled by the application distribution platforms
          (such as operating system app stores), not by Praisenter itself.
        </p>

        <h5>Information Collection and Use</h5>
        <p>
          Praisenter does not directly collect or process personal information.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>No personal data is collected by the application</li>
          <li>No in-application usage tracking or telemetry is performed</li>
          <li>No application data is transmitted to external servers</li>
          <li>No analytics, advertising, or marketing frameworks are used</li>
          <li>No cloud services or remote APIs are accessed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All application content and configuration data remain entirely on the local system under the user's control.
        </p>

        <h5>App Store Usage</h5>
        <p>
          When Praisenter is installed or used, limited usage information may be collected by the application store
          or operating system platform through which the app is distributed (for example, the Microsoft Store,
          Apple App Store,Ubuntu Snap Store, or similar services).
        </p>
        <p>
          This information may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Installation counts</li>
          <li>Crash reports</li>
          <li>Basic usage or performance metrics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This data is collected and processed by the app store provider, not by Praisenter, and is subject to the
          privacy policy of the respective platform. Praisenter does not receive, store, or control any personally
          identifiable information from these sources.
        </p>

        <h5>Screen Capture / Recording</h5>
        <p>
          Praisenter includes a few features that use screen capture/recording. Screen capture/recording is used
          solely for visual aids or the presentation of content within the application.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Screen capture is performed locally on the user's system</li>
          <li>Captured visuals are not transmitted or uploaded by Praisenter</li>
          <li>Screen capture is initiated and controlled by the user</li>
          <li>Captured content remains accessible only to the user unless shared externally by the user</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Praisenter does not monitor, analyze, or retain screen content beyond its intended local use.
        </p>

        <h5>Data Storage</h5>
        <p>
          All Praisenter data, including presentations, media, settings, and any screen-captured visuals, are stored
          locally
          on the user's device.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>No cloud uploads</li>
          <li>No cross-device synchronization</li>
          <li>No remote backups</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Users are responsible for managing their own local data and backups.
        </p>

        <h5>Third-Party Services</h5>
        <p>
          Aside from distribution via app stores, Praisenter does not integrate with third-party
          services for analytics, advertising, or data collection.
        </p>

        <h5>Website</h5>
        <p>
          This website uses <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/learn">Google Analytics</a> to track usage
          of the website itself.
          The information is aggregate in nature, consisting of metrics like browser, operating system, country/region,
          screen size, and so on.
        </p>

        <h5>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h5>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect application changes, platform requirements,
          or legal obligations. Updates will be made available through the Praisenter website or application
          distribution channels.
